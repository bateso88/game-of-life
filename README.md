# Conway's Game of Life

The Game of life is a zero player game developed in the 70's by John Horton Conway. Check out the [Wikipedia article](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conway%27s_Game_of_Life) for a full description.
The evolving state of the game is determined by the initial configuration - some configurations become infinitely evolving constellations, others eventually evolve into a stable patterns, whilst others die off completely.
It is commonly used as a tech test as it can be solved in many different ways that clearly show the level of the programmer.

### The Brief

The rules are as follows:

* The game evolves in turns, commonly known as 'ticks'.
* All changes occur at the same time.
* Any live cell with 2 or 3 live neighbours survives until next tick.
* Any live cell with less than 2 live neighbours dies (underpopulation).
* Any live cell with more than 3 live neighbours dies (overpopulation).
* Any dead cell with exactly 3 neighbours becomes a live cell (reproduction).

Write code that is capable of calculating each new generation, given a starter board. Although you don't have to build a visualisation tool to be able to see the evolution, it should be easy to extend the program to add on a web or command line UI.
